# ML – Supervised Learning Pipeline
---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train and evaluate classification models using labeled datasets. The process includes:

-  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
-  **Model training** on labeled data
-  **Testing and evaluation** on a separate dataset
-  **Hyperparameter tuning and optimization**

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Files

- `ml_supervised_learning_pipeline` – The main Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis, model training, and evaluation.
